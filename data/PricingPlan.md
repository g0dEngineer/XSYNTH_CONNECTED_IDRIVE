Tagline: xSynth Connected iDrive, an automobile/console mounted, embodied Ai/3d humanoid/conversational friend/helpful assistant utilizing IBM's Ai infrastructure enabling functions from friendly conversation to xSynth being able to tell driver of the nearest hospital, or getting xSynth to remind the driver of the closest oil filter depot. (Works with default car console)


# Implementation/Innovation/Execution & Beyond:
xSynth Connected iDrive, embodied ai mini-ecosystem, a 3d humanoid/conversational friend/helpful assistant utilizing IBM's Ai infrastructure to do:

a. Voice synthesis/voice detection
b. Return answers based on user speech


xSynth Capacity:

1. Hold friendly conversations (Implemented)

2. Provide utility assistance for notifying driver of nearest garage in time of urgency (Implemented Partially)

3. Provide utility assistance for notifying driver of nearest police 

4. Provide utility assistance for notifying driver of nearest hospital

5. Provide xSynth ecosystem via independent tablet, connected via Flow Yaad and Road Service (Internet connectivity ~anywhere).

This will integrate with Android based Car Consoles (which encompasses many manufacturers).
Additionally, we aim to offer an independent mountable tablet with the capacity to handle Flow Jamaica's Nano Sim Cards, which 
enables internet connectivity to facilitate xSynth's functions.




# User Experience Layout/Design:

Natural Interface Theme:

Naturally speaking 3d humanoid that drivers can interact with in parked mode, or otherwise receive likely relevant utility guidelines/warnings through voice in motion/while parked.



# Presentation/Communication format aimed:

Demo done live in the Civic Type R automobile.



# Business Appeal:

Ai (especially Ai related to self driving vehicles and technology) is estimated to yield an 80 trillion market cap by around 2030
according to studied firms, including Ark Invest. 

Embodied Ai is estimated, including Robo Taxis, and Ai driven apps for personal cars, are on the rise.

We wish to offer this unique experience, while marketing this utility tool.

We want to also implement an xSynth store (tm) which includes mod kits consumers can by for their cars' xsynths, like cosmetic upgrades, and beyond that, drones synchronized with xSynth that follow the consumers' cars around, to offer extra measures of security and or infotainment related record/replay features (drone upgrades, cosmetic swaps, as well as merchandise like clothing could also occur through the xSynth store).
